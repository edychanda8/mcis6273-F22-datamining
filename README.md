Github (https://github.com) is the de facto platform for open source software in the world based on the very popular 
git (https://git-scm.org) version control system. Git has a sophisticated set of tools for version control based on the c
oncept of local repositories for fast commits and remote repositories only when collaboration and remote synchronization is necessary. 
Github enhances git by providing tools and online hosting of public and private repositories to encourage and promote sharing and collaboration. 
Github hosts some of the worldâ€™s most widely used open source software.
